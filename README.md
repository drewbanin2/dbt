**[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)** (data build tool) enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.

dbt is the T in Tomato. Organize, cleanse, denormalize, filter, rename, and pre-aggregate the raw data in your warehouse so that it's ready for analysis.

![dbt architecture](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/blob/master/etc/dbt-arch.png?raw=true)

dbt can be used to [aggregate pageviews into sessions](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/snowplow), calculate [ad spend ROI](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/facebook-ads), or report on [email campaign performance](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/mailchimp).

## Understanding dbt

Analysts using dbt can transform their data by simply writing select statements, while dbt handles turning these statements into tables and views in a data warehouse.

These select statements, or "models", form a dbt project. Models frequently build on top of one another – dbt makes it easy to [manage relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/ref) between models, and [visualize these relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/documentation), as well as assure the quality of your transformations through [testing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing).
